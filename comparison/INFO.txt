/comparison is a directory that contains the code for the correlation experiments that correspond with Figure C. and Supplementary Figure 1. 

/train contains the training code for 3 different model Multiplexer architectures. The training code for the 4th architecture is located in the BMtraining directory.

/inputs contains code to generate inputs for the correlation experiments. This is so a standardized set of sequences are used.

/get_predictions contains the code to make predictions with the trained models. These predictions are stored in /predictions.

/calcCorrelation contains the code to calculate the correlation comparison among architecture.

/full_vs_avg contains the code to process individual mutation effects prediction and per-position averaged mutation effect prediction comparisons.
